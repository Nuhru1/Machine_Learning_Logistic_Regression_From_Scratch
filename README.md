# Machine_Learning_Logistic_Regression_From_Scratch

 Linear regression algorithms are used to predict/forecast values but logistic regression is used for classification tasks.
 In this repo I will use it to perform classification task on iris dataset. The iris dataset contain 3 classes but I will drop one class and perform the classification on the 2 classes.
 
# Sigmoid Function (Logistic Function)

Logistic regression algorithm also uses a linear equation with independent predictors to predict a value. The predicted value can be anywhere between negative infinity to positive infinity. We need the output of the algorithm to be class variable, i.e 0-no, 1-yes. Therefore, we are squashing the output of the linear equation into a range of [0,1]. To squash the predicted value between 0 and 1, we use the sigmoid function.

Z is the Linear Equation and g is the sigmoid function

h is the Squashed output

We take the output(z) of the linear equation and give to the function g(x) which returns a squashed value h, the value h will lie in the range of 0 to 1.


letâ€™s visualize the graph of the sigmoid function for better understanding of squashing.

# Cost Function

we use a logarithmic loss function to calculate the cost for misclassifying.

# Calculating Gradients

the gradient will be used to update our theta_0, theta_1, theta_2, ...  in other to minimize our cost function after each iteration
